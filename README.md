# Roman Numeral Kata in Java

## The kata
The Romans wrote their numbers using letters; specifically the letters 'I' meaning '1', 'V' meaning '5', 'X' meaning '10', 'L' meaning '50', 'C' meaning '100', 'D' meaning '500', and 'M' meaning '1000'. There were certain rules that the numerals followed which should be observed.
The symbols 'I', 'X', 'C', and 'M' can be repeated at most 3 times in a row. The symbols 'V', 'L', and 'D' can never be repeated. The '1' symbols ('I', 'X', and 'C') can only be subtracted from the 2 next highest values ('IV' and 'IX', 'XL' and 'XC', 'CD' and 'CM'). Only one subtraction can be made per numeral ('XC' is allowed, 'XXC' is not). The '5' symbols ('V', 'L', and 'D') can never be subtracted.

The kata is to write the code (TDD style) to convert a roman numeral to arabic and back.

## Presentation
In the branch 'presentation-roman-to-arabic' you can find the presentation and the outcome of the live coding during the presentation
that was given on the 21st of May 2015 in Bangalore.

## Example
In the branch 'roman-to-decimal' you can find an example (with git history!) what we practised before the presentation.
This will give you an idea how we approached the kata.
